The solution involves iterating over the array and storing the keys to be removed separately. Then, these keys are used to remove elements from the array *after* the loop completes.  Here's a corrected version:

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
$keysToRemove = [];

foreach ($myArray as $key => $value) {
    if ($value === 2) {
        $keysToRemove[] = $key;
    }
}

foreach ($keysToRemove as $key) {
    unset($myArray[$key]);
}

print_r($myArray);
?>
```

This approach ensures that the array is modified correctly without interfering with the `foreach` loop's iteration process.  Alternatively, you can use `array_filter()` for a more concise solution:

```php
<?php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
$myArray = array_filter($myArray, function ($value) { return $value !== 2; });
print_r($myArray);
?>
```
